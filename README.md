**Regression Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
This project demonstrates how to build and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for solving a regression problem using Keras and TensorFlow.  
In this analysis, you will be predicting the strength of concrete using the given eight features that describe the component used in the mixture. These features are believed to be related to the final conpressive strength which include the amount of cement in Kilograms pre cubic meter, Blast.Furnace.Slag, Fly.Ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and aging period measure in days.

**Objective**
To predict continuous target values using a feedforward neural network (ANN), and evaluate its performance using metrics like MSE and MAE.
